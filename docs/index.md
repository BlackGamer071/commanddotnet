# Introduction

***Model your command line application interface in a class***

The purpose of this **framework** is to let developers focus on the core logic of command line application and forget about how arguments are **parsed** & **validated**. This library also let's you structure your CLI app into a hierarchy of commands and subcommands and **invokes appropriate methods** in your app based on user input.

It provides **out of the box CLI help** with full customization options.
