# CommandDotNet

## Documentation

Version 3 (legacy): https://v3.commanddotnet.bilal-fazlani.com

***Model your command line application interface in a class***

The purpose of this **framework** is to let developers focus on the core logic of command line application by defining commands with methods and arguments with parameters. 

*Out-of-the-box* support for help documentation, subcommmands, dependency injection, validation, piping, prompting, passwords, response files and more. 

Includes [test tools](https://commanddotnet.bilal-fazlani.com/test-tools) used by the framework to test all features of the framework.

Modify and extend the functionality of the framework through configuration and middleware.

### Example

```c#
public class Calculator
{
    public void Add(int value1, int value2)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Answer:  {value1 + value2}");
    }

    public void Subtract(int value1, int value2)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Answer:  {value1 - value2}");
    }
}
```

```c#
class Program
{
    static int Main(string[] args)
    {
        return new AppRunner<Calculator>().Run(args);
    }
}
```

With these two classes, we've defined an Add and Subtract command and help is automatically generated.

```bash
~
$ dotnet calc.dll -h
Usage: dotnet calc.dll

Usage: dotnet calc.dll [command]

Commands:

  Add
  Subtract

Use "dotnet calc.dll [command] --help" for more information about a command.

~
$ dotnet calc.dll Add -h
Usage: dotnet calc.dll Add [arguments]

Arguments:

  value1  <NUMBER>

  value2  <NUMBER>

~
$ dotnet calc.dll Add 40 20
Answer: 60
```
